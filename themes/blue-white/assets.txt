# This file should list every element of the mailer template in a list format. Each separate element should start with
# a $. Larger elements in the mailer with sub elements should be marked as any other element, yet the subelements should
# appear directly under the overarching element and should start with $$.
#
# Comments start with #, and will not be read by the parser. Only statements starting with $ will be read by the parser.
#
# Elements that are required for the mailer and that will be in the same position of the layout each time will start
# with the required. parameter.
